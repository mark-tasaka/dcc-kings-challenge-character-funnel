        <h3>Area 1: Portal Room</h3>
    
        <p>
        The character funnel starts with the characters entering the portal, a large circle carved into a stone floor.  When all the characters have stepped inside the circle, they will be surrounded by a field of blue light.  A few seconds later the blue light will fade, revealing the first room of the King’s Challenge.  A description of this room is below:
            
        </p>
        <div class="textbox">
                <p>
                The room is in the shape of a semi-circle, with a high domed ceiling.  An unknown light source illuminates the room, giving light to a room that should, by rights, be shroud in darkness.  Along the walls of the semi-circle are eight stone statues facing the portal.  Each statue represents a person, with a youthful appearance, dressed in long flowing robes.  At first glance, the statues appear to represent humans, but their features are far too perfect and beautiful to belong to the moral world of men.  Yet, they are not elves, even though they share many of the features of the elven race.  Rather, the statues perfectly blend the features of elves and men into one, bring perfect harmony between the two races. Perhaps, the statues represent the people who once lived in this kingdom, in ages long past…in times, long since forgotten.

        <h3>Area 27: Second Portal Room</h3>
        
        <p>The characters have reached the final room of the King’s Challenge.  This room is similar in appearance to the first portal room (a semi-circular room, with a domed high ceiling).  Shortly after entering the room a vision of the Mage-King and his retainers will appear before the characters.</p>
        
        <div class="textbox"><p>Several figures appear out of nothingness.  The figures stand in a semi-circle, in the same fashion as the statues stood at the start of this adventure.  There are 8 figures in total: four are male and four are female.  Each figure is dressed in a long flowing robe; their features perfectly combines the features of elves and men into a race that is neither men nor elves.</p>
            
        <p>One of the figures steps forward.  His age is hard to judge; his face is youthful, but his eyes belong to one who has lived many years; possibly many lifetimes.</p>
            
        <p>“You have passed my test”, the man says with a warm smile. “You have proved yourself worthy of entering a new life.  You will undergo a momentous change, as those who have passed my test before you have.  Please step forward, and enter the portal.”</p></div>
        
        <p>When the characters enter the portal, they will feel a renewed sense of strength.  They will reappear back at the ruins where they will be greeted by their fellow villagers.  The villagers will mourn those who have perished in the King’s Challenge and congratulation those who have passed the Mage-King’s test.</p>
        
        <p>The characters are now 1st level Adventurers, and can choose a character class (unless they are elves, dwarves or halflings, in which case their race will be their character class).  The weapons and coins the characters gained from the King’s Challenge will help them prepare for their next adventure as Level 1 characters.  So, what will the characters do next?  Will they return to their home village to mourn their fallen and spend time saying goodbye to their friends and family before embarking on their journey to a strange new world?  Or, will they immediately travel down the new road that lies ahead, never looking back to their past lives?  This will be up to you and your players to decide.</p>

The blade of the polearm is curved on one side to such an extent that it resembles a large fishing hook.</p></div><p>If any of the characters steps on the area rug they will begin to sink into the rug (the rug has a similar effect as quicksand, whereby the characters will sink at a gradual rate).  Initially a DC 4 Reflex save is required to leave the rug; each round a character stays in the rug the DC is increased by 4 (i.e. if a character stays in the sinking rug for the first round, then attempts to leave the rug on the second round, they will need to succeed a DC 8 Reflex saving throw; if that character fails this save, the next round they will need to make a DC 12 Reflex saving throw).  When the DC reaches 20, the character completely sinks into the rug and dies.</p><p>The characters could throw the statue into the rug to test the depth.  They will discover the rug is just over 6 feet deep.  If the characters use the hooked bladed polearm to probe the bottom of the sinking rug, they will discover pieces of armour at the bottom of the rug.  Using the hooked bladed polearm, they will be able to retrieve the armour piece by piece (i.e. first retrieving a gauntlet, then a helmet and so on).  At the end, the characters will have retrieved a well preserved and well-crafted suit of full-plate armour (human-size).</p><p>While the surface of the rug has the magical sinking effect, the bottom of the rug is normal.  Thus, the characters could roll the rug up.  If they do so, the characters will discover a trap door beneath the rug.  The trapdoor leads to a small cellar; there the characters will find a chainmail hauberk (human-size) on a armour stand and a longsword, spear and battle-axe on a weapon’s rack.</p>',

A trio of ale mugs sits on the table, and a worn leather coat rests on one of the couches.  Against one of the walls is a poorly constructed bookshelf, containing a dozen or so books.

The books on the bookshelf are filled with childish illustrations and scribbles.  Upon opening the dresser drawer, a strong scent of mothballs will fill the air.  Inside the drawer are tattered wool and cotton sheets and a collection of mothballs.  Hidden inside one of the sheets is a well-crafted curved silver bladed dagger with onyx gemstones embedded in the dagger’s handle.

            '<div class="textbox"><p>A square coffee table sits in the centre of the room; the coffee table is unvarnished and marked with scratches and stains.  Resting upon the coffee table are a set of playing cards, some dice and a worn leather-bound book.  On one side of the coffee table is a worn and tattered couch.  On the other side are a pair of equally worn chairs.  The legs of the chairs are low to the ground, likely designed to accommodate a dwarf or a halfling.  Behind the chairs is a pine chest.  There are 3 large mirrors, against separate walls; one of the mirrors is broken, with shards of glass scattered on the floor beneath it.</p></div><p>There are strange runes and designs on the faces of the playing cards; there are similar runes on the dice.  The centres of several of the pages of the leather-bound book have been cut out, hiding a brass key inside.  The key will unlock the pine chest behind the chairs.</p><p>The pine chest is locked and requires the brass key to unlock it.  Without the key, a DC 18 Strength check is required to forcefully open the chest (if a crowbar, dagger, chisel or other such tool is used to open the chest, the DC is reduced to 8).  The chest is trapped; if the chest is forcefully opened 3 darts will fire at the character who forcefully opened the chest.  The character will have to make 3 separate DC 10 Reflex saves to avoid being hit by the darts.  Each failed save will result in 1d3 points of damage.  Using the key will deactivate the trap.  The chest contains the following items: a dwarf-size suit of chainmail armour, a shield, a longsword, a crossbow and quiver containing 15 crossbow bolts.  The weapons and armour are of dwarven design.</p><p>If a character examines the unbroken mirrors, they will see their reflection looking back at them.  They will notice several odd things about their reflection (i.e. their reflection will not mimic their movements).  They will also notice that their reflection is trying to communicate with them; trying to tell them to break the mirror.  If a character breaks the mirror their reflection will appear before them.  The reflection is an identical copy of the character, and possess the same statistics and items the character possesses.  The reflections could join the party as zero-level PCs, replacing some of the zero-level characters who have perished along the way.</p>',

Against another wall is a shelf containing a jar of pipe weed, 2 bottles of brady and a dozen brady snifters.</p></div><p>The ottoman contains a hidden compartment (a DC 5 Intelligence check is required to find the hidden compartment).  Inside the hidden compartment is a coin box containing  '+ Math.floor(Math.random() * 200 +100) +'  silver pieces.  The brandy is of the finest quality, possessing all the qualities of perfectly aged brandy.  If a character smokes the pipe weed, they must succeed a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw.  A failed saving throw will result in the character’s attack rolls, saving throws and skill checks being reduced by -1d (i.e. their attack rolls will be reduced to 1d16) for the next 3 hours.</p><p>If a character picks up one of the books, the book will yell “Put me down!” and materialize a pair of legs.  The book will break free from the character’s grip, and run around the room frantically.  This will cause the other books on the bookshelf to materialize pairs of legs, and run around the room frantically.  There will be 20 books running around the room, screaming “Don’t touch me!”, “Stay away from me!”, etc.  The characters could attempt to capture the books.  This will require a DC 15 Agility check for each book.  However, the books will continue to scream, kick, etc., when captured.</p>',

The woman is beautiful; she is dressed in white; her skin and hair are pale.  A soft white glow surrounds the woman.</p></div><p>The first character to try to interaction with the woman must make a DC 12 Will saving throw.  A failed saving throw will result in the character falling madly in love with the woman and the two of them will float away into the mirror (at this point the character is lost forever).  If the character passes this saving throw, the woman vanishes and the character is surrounded by a bright aura of white light.  The white light will fade away, and the character will feel a sense of energy surge through their body.
